This document lists all the modifications that were done in order to make
BiG-SLICE run.

1- Use numpy=1.24 in the installation (previous versions have a compatibility problem)

2- Download the updated HMMs database: download_bigslice_hmmdb https://s3.amazonaws.com/share.jgi-ga.org/satria/bigslice-models.2022-11-30.tar.gz

3- Modify line 98 of the bgc.py module to accept “False” as a version
(i.e., if antismash_version.split(".")[0] in ["5", "6", "7", "False"]:)
In this way it is possible for BiGSLICE to recognize the MIBiG 3 GenBank.

4- Check that the bgc_ids for which the “features” (i.e., hmm annotations) are going to be extracted are present in the features data.frame. For this I added the following two lines (177 and 178 of the birch.py ​​module):

bgc_ids_present = list(features_df.index.values)
bgc_ids = list(set(bgc_ids_present) & set(bgc_ids))

To then run the original line (179):
features_df = features_df.loc[bgc_ids]
